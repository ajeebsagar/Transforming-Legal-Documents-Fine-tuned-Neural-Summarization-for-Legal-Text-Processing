## 📝 Abstract

This research presents an innovative approach to legal document summarization using advanced neural network architectures. We introduce a fine-tuned BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model specifically adapted for processing complex legal texts. The system addresses the critical challenge of efficiently digesting lengthy legal documents while preserving essential legal context and meaning. By leveraging the BillSum dataset, comprising US Congressional bills and their summaries, we demonstrate the model's capability to generate concise, accurate, and contextually relevant summaries. Our implementation achieves this through a carefully crafted preprocessing pipeline, sophisticated neural architecture, and comprehensive evaluation using ROUGE metrics. The system supports processing of documents up to 15,000 characters while generating summaries between 10 and 2,000 characters, making it particularly suitable for real-world legal document processing applications.The implementation incorporates several technical innovations, including dynamic padding for efficient batch processing, beam search decoding for optimal summary generation, and a linear learning rate schedule with warmup for stable training. Our model architecture utilizes a sequence-to-sequence transformer with an input context window of 512 tokens and a maximum generation length of 128 tokens, striking a balance between computational efficiency and comprehensive document understanding. The training process employs the AdamW optimizer with a carefully tuned learning rate of 3e-5 and weight decay of 0.01, along with gradient accumulation steps to handle larger effective batch sizes on limited hardware resources. Experimental results show promising performance in maintaining legal accuracy while significantly reducing document length, potentially saving valuable time for legal professionals and making legal documents more accessible to non-experts. The system's modular design allows for easy integration into existing legal document management systems, while its GPU acceleration support ensures efficient processing of large document collections.
